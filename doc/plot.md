The script plot.py is used to generate visualizations of the data stored in the result_t.csv and result_x.csv files, which are located in the data directory. The script uses the pandas library to read the data from these files and the matplotlib library to generate the visualizations.

The first part of the script imports the necessary libraries and reads in the parameters from the params.txt file, which is located in the data directory. The script then reads the data from the result_t.csv and result_x.csv files using the pd.read_csv() function from the pandas library.

The script then creates a 2x3 grid of subplots using the plt.subplots() function from the matplotlib library. The first subplot, ax1, is a time plot of the v_perp_eV and v_para_eV values, with a secondary y-axis showing the pitch_angle values. The second subplot, ax2, is similar to the first but with a logarithmic x-axis. The third subplot, ax5, is a plot of x values versus v_perp_eV and v_para_eV values, with secondary y-axis showing the relative_density and pitch_angle values. The remaining subplots are similar to these and show the same data with different scales or formatting.

The script then saves the figure with plt.savefig() function, it saves the figure in the data directory with the name result.png.

Finally, the script displays the figure using plt.show() function.
